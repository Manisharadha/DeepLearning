# DeepLearning
This directory contains code to set up a Deep Learning Network (DNN).
It starts with a Logistic regression, followed by a single hidden layer Neural network
for image classification.
A Deep Neural Network is built for image classification.
There is code to tune the DNN hyperparameters, starting with initialization, regularization, optimization and gradient checking.
